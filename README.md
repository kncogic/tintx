WHITEPAPER / PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
TINT X PROJECT

Documented Date: 2017-09-23
FOUNDER:  KIMSE TUATONGHA
DEVELOPMENT TEAM IN PARTNERSHIP: SCOUTING PHASE

1. VISION
Integrating data analytics and blockchain technology in vetting industrial/investment progress. 
This is a TOKEN + PRODUCT project developed on the blockstack platform aimed at providing better support for token projects and investors and other companies developed on the blockchain technology.

2. PROBLEM
ICO TOKENS are being created and investor cash are going into businesses that are destined to fail. 
New investors coming into the blockchain technology markets are confused about the technology, where to invest in, how to track company progress pre-and post ICO’s, and where to find potential opportunities, news and extra information. 
Currently there is a manual process for solving these issues but not everyone has the time to spend hours researching ICO’s before getting in on it. We take out the time and the work with this project. 
We also plan on integrating a tax payment system to assist our clients on taxation on their investments in relevance to their country of origin.

PRODUCT DEPLOYMENT
First step is to lunch initiate thorough R and D and prototype deployment for this project. 
Our product will be deployed within 0-6 months R and D, Prototype Design, basic licensing and product lunch. 

BUSINESS MODEL:
Our customers – ICO token issuers, VC's and Investors, average individuals. 
Approximately 30 ICO's are in pre-opening stages each month. A lot will fail and a few will succeed. We are the filter.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY.
Implementing deep learning and blockchain technology in the evaluation of ICO token issuers. In an ecosystem that has grown in strides within the last 8 years I see an opportunity that no one is paying attention to. Our product will maintain stability and customer confidence in this sector.

MILESTONES
1.	0-6 months R and D, prototype design, basic licensing and product lunch. 
2.	2. 6-12 months re-evaluate prototype with active users re-analyze data and market direction.
3.	12-24 months lunch of final product.
4.	User interface devices: Web platform, IOS and Android app.

The grading process for successful ICO’s will take into consideration the market audience (support from the community) the readiness of direct implementation of that ICO project, similar ICO’s in their space their progress, and the developers weekly activities (Partnerships and integration to other projects). Tonnes of data will have to be analyzed and re-analyzed on past and present and new ICO’s introduced in the system, it will also need current information on government/industry regulation and community acceptance (Community Support). The whole project is going to be based on DAPP with a blockchain ledger for storing users information e.t.c.

A CSV file with data on ICO progress will be very useful. Transparency is very important, it is very necessary that the accuracy and predictability of this project is among the top 5 of similar platforms or software out there to boost everyone’s confidence in the platform because if several ICO’s are given a good rating and continuously under-perform it is going to show the project in a bad light (This is the most important point to be as accurate as possible).

Hard work and dedication plus taking a few things out and tweaking a few others will push the project in the right direction. 

Note: If a project such as this was in place during “the dot com bubble” most mistakes could have been avoided and maybe lost investments would have been directed to more promising projects. That is the goal of the project.
